#1a. You need a list of all the actors’ first name and last name
select first_name, last_name from actor;

#1b. Display the first and last name of each actor in a single column in upper case letters. Name the column Actor Name
Select concat(upper(first_name), ' ', upper(last_name)) Actor_Name from actor;

#2a. You need to find the id, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name of "Joe." 
#What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
select actor_id,first_name,last_name from actor where first_name iLike 'Joe';

#2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters GEN. Make this case insensitive
select * from actor where last_name iLike '%GEN%';

#2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters LI. 
# This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order. Make this case insensitive.

#2d. Using IN, display the country_id and country columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China:
Select country_id, country from country where country IN ('Afghanistan','Bangladesh','China');

#3a. Add a middle_name column to the table actor. Specify the appropriate column type
ALTER TABLE actor ADD COLUMN middle_name VARCHAR(255)

#3b. You realize that some of these actors have tremendously long last names. 
#Change the data type of the middle_name column to something that can hold more than varchar.
ALTER TABLE actor ALTER COLUMN middle_name SET DATA TYPE text;

#3c. Now write a query that would remove the middle_name column.
ALTER TABLE actor DROP COLUMN middle_name;

UPDATE actor 
SET first_name = 'HARPO' 
WHERE first_name ilike '%Groucho%' and last_name ilike '%Williams%'

#4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing GROUCHO to HARPO. It turns out that GROUCHO was the correct name after all! 
UPDATE actor SET
first_name = CASE WHEN first_name = 'HARPO' THEN 'GROUCHO' ELSE 'MUCHO GROUCHO'
END
WHERE actor_id = 172;

#5a. 
#What’s the difference between a left join and a right join. 
A left join joins in everything from the left side of a table, even if there are no matches.
A right join  joins in everything from the right side of a table, even if there are no matches.

#What about an inner join and an outer join?
An inner join finds and returns matching data from tables, while an outer join finds and returns matching data and some dissimilar data from tables.


#When would you use rank?
When you want to rank a group or an individual id by a set of data, and you are fine with ties.

#What about dense_rank? 
When you want to do a rank without any gaps, e.g. no ties.

#When would you use a subquery in a select? 
You would use them in instances where you cannott get data through a normal select query, such as when you are trying access the value of a lead or lag
for a comparison. It is also simpler code to write than a join in some instances. (Ex.That Signifyd question)

#When would you use a right join?
When you want the data from the table that is being joined. 

#When would you use an inner join over an outer join?
When you only want values that match on both sides. 
See(Question 6c.)

#What’s the difference between a left outer and a left join
They are the same.

#When would you use a group by?
If you are collecting aggregate data using an SQL function such as count, and want to display that count.
Ex.: select staff_id, count(payment) from payment GROUP BY staff_id;

#Describe how you would do data reformatting

select
   trim('  Software Engineer  ');

In the example above you would be removing spaces.

#When would you use a with clause?
When you are running multiple subqueries on a table and want to easily rename the first one for the purpose of being referenced later on.


#bonus: When would you use a self join?
You would use a self join when trying to access data from a table when you are trying to access information from two different rows 
that have a relationship with each other.
For example, you want to get data from the first row after a row where the first_name is Pavan.

#6a. Use a JOIN to display the first and last names, as well as the address, of each staff member. Use the tables staff and address:
